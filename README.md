This repo contains the all the Jupyter notebooks for calculating the noisy expectation values using the IBM quantum machine and the expectaion valuse using classical noise in ref "Self-protected quantum simulation and quantum-phase
estimation in the presence of classical noise". The goal is to make a comparioson between the two.
